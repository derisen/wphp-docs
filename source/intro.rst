Introduction
============

The Women’s Print History Project 1750-1836 (WPHP) is the first comprehensive bibliographical database of women's contributions to print for one of the most convulsive periods in the history of both women’s writing and print. The database, with nearly 2,000 person entries and over 8,000 title entries, will enable rigorous quantitative analysis of patterns in women's print history.

This application was developed by the `Digital Humanities Innovation Lab`_ at `Simon Fraser University`_ with considerable assistance and support from the `SFU Library`_.
